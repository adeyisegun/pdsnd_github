## Description
The Explore US Bikeshare Data project focuses on analyzing the usage patterns of bike-sharing systems in three major cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The project utilizes Python to import, analyze, and compute descriptive statistics on the provided data. Additionally, an interactive terminal script is developed to present the findings.

Bike-sharing systems have gained immense popularity over the past decade, offering users a convenient and eco-friendly mode of transportation. These systems allow individuals to rent bicycles for short durations, making point-to-point travel accessible and efficient. With the advancement of information technologies, bike-sharing systems generate vast amounts of data that can be leveraged to gain insights into usage patterns and user behavior.

The data used for this project is provided by Motivate, a leading bike share system provider for major cities in the United States. By exploring the data, we aim to uncover interesting trends and statistics related to bike share usage in Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
